I’m currently in Bali, doing a 10-day intensive front-end website development course. We’re only on day 2, but I’ve already learned so much more about code, HTML and CSS than I managed to learn doing online courses, useful as they were. There’s something about learning with people and being able to ask question and try things out. The online courses were like learning a language from a phrasebook, whereas this feels like learning it in the country.
<br>
<br>Of course the gorgeous environment helps!
<br>
<br>Because I’m me, I’ve been thinking about the wider issues raised by this course as much as being present in the moment. Things like the parallels between coding and languages – the importance of basic structure and grammar before you can start getting fancy. How learning can be so context dependent. How teaching is its own separate and hugely important skill, separate from knowing the subject matter.
<br>
<br>I’m looking forward to the rest of the week!
