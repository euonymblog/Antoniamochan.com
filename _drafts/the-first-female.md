I started work at the age of 22, in 1993. Even then, it seemed crazy that I could ever be the first woman anything – surely those bridges had all been burned by my mother’s generation? So, when I became Head of Media at the European Commission’s Representation in London in 2008, I was astonished to be told I was the first woman to have that role.

&nbsp;

Then in one week last November, the first female President of Nepal was elected and the Australia saw the first female jockey to win its biggest horserace, the Melbourne Cup. It made me wonder, how many women are there out there who are the “first female” in their field. I decided to start logging them when I found them.

&nbsp;

Since then, hundreds and hundreds of posts have gone up. Public service (police and fire service), military, academia and even a few in the corporate sector (!).

And there’s also a&nbsp;[Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/thefirstfemale/), which has slightly different content. Please send me any you find. And let me know your own First Female stories.
