  - title: gardenear.me
    website: 'http://gardenear.me'
    image: /images/gardenear.png
    explanation: This is a site I developed as part of the SheHacks hackathon in July 2017. It's built in pure HTML and CSS. I'm really pleased with the clean lines of it, the choice of photos and the way the nav arrows disappear on the mobile version.
  - title: Balaclava Life
    website: 'http://balaclava3183.life'
    image: /images/balaclava.png
    explanation: This was the main project I worked on during my HTML/CSS course in May 2017. It's a site about the part of Melbourne I live in, with reviews, news and events. It's built in HTML/CSS, with a little bit of jQuery, and is a static site using Jekyll. I love the drop down menu and how information about each place reviewed can be easily inputted.
  - title: EU-Australia Leadership Forum
    website: 'http://euausforum.eu'
    image: /images/EUAusForum.png
    explanation: I created this mobile site for a conference in June 2017. It had information about the schedule, speakers and participants. It was built in HTML/CSS/jQuery and is a static site using Jekyll ( a LOT of Jekyll, thank god for Cloud Cannon's CMS...). I am super-happy with the dynamic participant search, and how all the items cross-referenced correctly.
