  <h1>Digital Communications</h1>
  <h2>Your website is at the heart of your communication</h2>

<div class="siteexplanation">
    <p>
      A website is a virtual shopfront, letting your customers, clients or potential partners know who you are and what you stand for. But still almost half of Australian small businesses don't have an online presence. I've been involved in digital communication for as long as I can remember, and have a clear idea of how you can make the best use of digital communications to help you achieve your goals.

      I've been building my own sites using templates like Wordpress, Weebly, Strikingly etc for over a decade and have recently taken it to the next level, learning to code sites myself. What sort of site is right for you? What sort of design will suit your audience? How much work will it be to keep it up-to-date? These are key questions that I can help you with.

      It's not only about what your site looks like - it's also important to get the tone right, and provide copy that speaks to your audience, preferably free of grammatical and spelling mistakes. Good writing is probably my best-honed skill. Having a developer that can also write copy can save you a lot of time and money.

      Your website sits at the heart of a network of media channels these days - Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, depending on your audience. There are also many other tools that can help you be more productive. I have a lot of experience with social media, automation and integration tools, so that everything works together well.
